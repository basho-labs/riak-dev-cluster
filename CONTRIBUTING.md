     `git checkout -b some-topic-branch`
* Make your changes and run the test suite if one is provided (see below)
* Commit your changes and push them to your fork
* Open a pull request for the appropriate project
* Contributors will review your pull request, suggest changes, and merge it when it’s ready and/or offer feedback
